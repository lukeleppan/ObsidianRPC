### A Discord Rich Presence Plugin for Obsidian

This was thrown together in an hour and it works but no promises.

So far this plugin works with the unofficial volcano plugin loader but it will be adapted in the future when official extension support is added.

### Install:

- Download `discord-rpc.zip` from latest release.
- Copy all files from the zip file to `~/volcano/plugins
- Reload Obsidian
- Enjoy üëç

#### Warning:

The plugin will show the name of the file you are editing as well as the name of your vault.
